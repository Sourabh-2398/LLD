# Prototype Pattern

## Theory

The Prototype Pattern is a creational design pattern that allows you to create new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype. 
Instead of creating new instances from scratch, you clone a prototype, which can be more efficient when object creation is costly or complex. 
This pattern is especially useful when the objects to be created are similar to existing ones or when instantiation involves a lot of configuration.

### Structure
- **Prototype**: Declares a method for cloning itself (e.g., `clone()` in Java).
- **ConcretePrototype**: Implements the clone method to return a copy of itself.
- **Client**: Creates new objects by copying the prototype.

### Benefits
- Reduces the cost of creating complex objects.
- Avoids the need for subclasses to create new objects.
- Simplifies object creation when many similar objects are needed.

### When to Use
- When object creation is expensive or complex.
- When you need to create objects that are similar to existing ones.
- When you want to avoid building a hierarchy of factories.

The Prototype Pattern is commonly used in frameworks and libraries for duplicating objects, such as in graphical editors, game development, and configuration management.
